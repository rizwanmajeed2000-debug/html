                    <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
                    <p>Dogs, widely known as "man's best friend," are domesticated mammals celebrated for their remarkable loyalty,
                    intelligence, and companionship. Descended from wolves over 15,000 years ago, they have evolved into hundreds of
                    distinct breeds, ranging from tiny lapdogs like Poodles to powerful working breeds like German Shepherds. They possess
                    extraordinary senses, including a sense of smell at least 40 times more sensitive than a human's and the ability to hear
                    high-pitched frequencies. Beyond being beloved household pets, dogs serve vital roles in society as service animals for
                    people with disabilities, sniffer dogs for law enforcement, and therapy animals that provide emotional support. <aside>Their
                    playful and protective nature, combined with their unique ability to understand human emotions, makes them one of the
                    most cherished animals in the world.</aside></p>
