    <h1>Elements of HTML.</h1>
    <p>Elements of HTML are used to design the structure and format of a website.<i>For example,</i>bold, italic, strong etc.</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p><mark>HTML has upto 6 headings, each going to smaller sizes as made.</mark></p>
    We can also use the tags of sub and super to write formulas. <i>For example,</i><br>
    H<sub>2</sub>O is the formula for water and to write the 2 below H, we use the sub tag.<br>
    2<sup>3</sup> Here, to write 3 as the power of 2, we use the sup tag.<br>
    Now, I will shows the rest of the examples of <b>Different types of headings.</b><br>
    <h3>This is heading 3.</h3>
    <h4>This is heading 4.</h4>
    <h5>Thus is heading 5.</h5>
    <h6>And this is heading 6, the smallest heading.</h6>
